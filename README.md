# Turing Machine Interpreter

This interpreter is an MIT-licensed open source project that focuses on providing
the best interpreter for your turing machine projects. It comes with many
advanced features that set it appart from other turing interpreters.

## Interpreter error handling
When the interpreter reads in your turing table, it will check that it is in
the proper format. Giving you useful error messages to common programming typos.
 
When converting a turing diagram into a table, you can easily make mistakes and
duplicate a state. The compiler will catch that mistake and will print out the
two lines that are duplicated.

## Comments!
One of the biggest challenges of creating a turing table is understanding the
state transitions. Because of this, the interpreter ignores all in-line
comments.
